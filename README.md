# Flutter-gridview-homepage

This is a general template for creating a gridview home page.  Clicking on each gridview item will take you to it's page.

The constants file, constants.dart contains many of the properties that can be used to adjust the look of the app.

There is a settings menu where you can set the background and text color of the main screen.

The color values are saved using shared preferences to persist the data.
